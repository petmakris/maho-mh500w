The Smart Serial Card Configuration is very new.

At this time the Smart Serial Card will create
a net with a signal name and you will have to 
add the input or output pin name or create simple 
I/O connections.

The 7i83 and 7i87 are not currently supported.

The Smart Serial Card configuration will not load
from the ini file at this time.
